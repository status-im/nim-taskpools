# eventcounts.nim

# This file implements an eventcount
# It allows putting idle threads to sleep or waking them up.

# This is the lock-free equivalent of a condition variable.

    ## The lock-free equivalent of a condition variable.
    ##
    ## Usage, if a thread needs to be parked until a condition is true
    ##       and signaled by another thread:
    ## ```Nim
    ## if condition:
    ##   return
    ##
    ## while true:
    ##   ticket = ec.sleepy()
    ##   if condition:
    ##     ec.cancelSleep()
    ##     break
    ##   else:
    ##     ec.sleep()
    ## ```

    state: Atomic[uint]
    # State is actually the equivalent of a bitfield
    # type State = object
    #   waiters {.bitsize: 16.}: uint16
    #   when sizeof(pointer) == 4:
    #     epoch {.bitsize: 16.}: uint16
    #   else:
    #     epoch {.bitsize: 48.}: uint48
    #
    # of size, the native integer size
    # and so can be used for atomic operations on 32-bit or 64-bit platforms.
    # but there is no native fetchAdd for bitfield
    futex: Futex
    # Technically we could use the futex as the state.
    # When you wait on a Futex, it waits only if the value of the futex
    # matches with a reference value.
    # But our reference value will be the epoch of notifications
    # and it is non-trivial to zero-out the waiters bits.
    # - One way could be to split a 64-bit number in 2
    #   and cast the epoch part to Futex but that would only work on 64-bit CPU.
    # - Another more hacky way would be to pad with a zero-out uint16 before and after the Futex
    #   and depending on big or little endian provide a shifted address as Futex.
